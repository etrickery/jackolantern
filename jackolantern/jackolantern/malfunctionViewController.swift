Your ABS system helps provide traction when braking on slick surfaces such as gravel, rain, snow or ice. If the light is illuminated, the system has failed and will be disabled.

        let mil10 : milTableData = milTableData(title: "Gas-Cap Light", icon: "gascap.png", details: "This light indicates an Evaporative Emissions System (EVAP) failure. Your vehicle seals the fuel tank to capture evaporated fuel. Once and a while, it will then purge the collected condensate into the engine to remove it. This light indicates a problem within that system. Generally, the most common error is a poorly sealed Gas Cap. After checking the gas cap, several drive cycles must occur before the light will clear. You may have to drive it for a few days to clear the light. If it doesn't go out after several drive cycles, the Check Engine Light will be activated. While this problem usually has little effect on the performance of the vehicle, it can cause problems if left unchecked. In emissions controlled states, your vehicle's Evaporative Emissions System must be functional. A leak can allow contaminates into the fuel and gasoline will literally evaporate out of the tank. Bad for the environment, yet also impacting your wallet, the evap system can let more sinister substances find their way into your engine, resulting in damage or larger problems.", image: "mil.jpg")

Some manufacturers have designed the vehicle to store a code detailing which light is out, while others simply indicate a broken connection somewhere in the system. Have a friend work the lights while you walk around your vehicle. Try combinations of lights like headlamps, brake lights and turn signals. Turn them on together, seperate, and all at once. Doublecheck running lights and marker lights by looking at both sides multiple times. What looks like a reflector could harbor a bad bulb. Check your license plate bulbs. Don't forget foglamps, daytime running lamps and reverse lights. Some bulbs are easier to change than others. Handling the glass of a bulb shortens it's lifespan considerably. If you do touch it, polish your finger's oil off of the surface prior to turning the lights on. A greasy fingerprint can cause a bulb to fail in minutes. Most autoparts stores will change bulbs for free, if you purchase the bulb there. Even many dealerships will, although this is generally used to get you in the door to sell more repairs.", image: "headlights.jpg")

Low oil pressure can indicate a low oil level or internal engine problem. High oil pressure can be dangerous as well. A light may also indicate a failed oil pressure sensor or wiring problem as well. It is recommended that you have the oil pressure tested and determine if there really is a pressure problem, or just a bad sensor. An oil pressure problem can damage the engine, and should be avoided if at all possible.", image: "openHood.jpg")

The light comes on when Over-Drive is disabled, and goes out when it is re-enabled.", image: "bigTruck.jpg")

This light should be taken serious. The light can also indicate that the vehicle's computers cannot determine if damage is occurring due to failed sensors. In this case, the engine is not in danger neccesarily, but the computer can not verify that so it will err on the safe side and set the indicator and reduce the engine power. Sometimes a glitch could cause it, and shutting the car off and restarting it may help, but generally this is not the case. See your local repair facility as soon as possible to ensure minimal damge to your vehicle. ", image: "transmission.jpg")

When you start the vehicle, the chip is read by a sensor, which tells the computers to either allow the vehicle to run, or disable it. A failure of the key, the ignition switch, or a variety of modules can cause this light to set. Unfortunately this is generally a light best left to dealerships. Very few repair shops can handle vehicle key programming.", image: "keyfob.jpg")

Check the driver-side door jam for pressure specifications. Temperature variations in the Fall or Winter can cause tire pressure to drop, which will set the light. Tire leaks, bad valve stems or poorly sealed mounting can cause tires to leak. A tire shop can quickly adjust these things.
